      <p className='travel-intro'>This is a mighty fine Next.js social media site. Only the first ever social media site that is anonymous! That's right, we sell your anonymous data and let someone with AI networking technology predict who it is so you just think it anonymous. Mwahaha. You can let us all here know where you are and what you're doing, so we can sell that info too!!</p>
